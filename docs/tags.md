# Tags

Tags can be added to your blog posts to help index and organise them. Tags are similar to categories in that they can be used to categorise your posts, but tags are meant to be more flexible and non-heirachical and used to label and index your posts.

## Settings

The following three settings can be used to configure the tags feature:

- [TAG_ENABLED](#tag-enabled): boolean, default is True.
- [TAG_PREFIX](#tag-prefix): string, default is "tag".
- [CACHE_TAGS](#cache-tags): boolean, default is False.
